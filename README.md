# Filecoin Proofs FFI

> C and CGO bindings for Filecoin's Rust libraries

## Building

To build and install libfilcrypto, its header file and pkg-config manifest, run:

```shell
make
```

If no precompiled static library is available for your operating system, the
build tooling will attempt to compile a static library from local Rust sources.

### Forcing Local Build

To opt out of downloading precompiled assets, set `FFI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1`:

```shell
rm .install-filcrypto \
    ; make clean \
    ; FFI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1 make
```
## go get

`go get` needs some additional steps in order to work as expected.

Get the source, add this repo as a submodule to your repo, build it and point to it:

```shell
$ go get github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-ffi
$ git submodule add https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-ffi.git extern/filecoin-ffi
$ make -C extern/filecoin-ffi
$ go mod edit -replace=github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-ffi=./extern/filecoin-ffi
```

## Updating CGO Bindings

The CGO bindings are generated using [c-for-go](https://github.com/xlab/c-for-go)
and committed to Git. To generate bindings yourself, install the c-for-go
binary, ensure that it's on your path, and then run `make cgo-gen`. CI builds
will fail if generated CGO diverges from what's checked into Git.
